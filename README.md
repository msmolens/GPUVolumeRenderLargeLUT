GPUVolumeRenderLargeLUT
=======================

Overview
--------

VTK example program to GPU volume render an image using a large lookup table.

This example replicates the VTK setup in Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/) when
rendering the brain atlas from nac-hncma-atlas-2015Nov-Slicer4-4Version.mrb on
http://www.spl.harvard.edu/publications/item/view/2037.

With the OpenGL2 backend the rendering isn't as expected.

Slicer has been using a local patch for the OpenGL backend to make the label map
render as expected:
https://github.com/Slicer/VTK/commit/f34413a

A discussion about adding this patch to upstream VTK is here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/merge_requests/1048

The original Slicer issue is here:
